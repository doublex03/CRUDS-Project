# 📦 CRUDS Project - Product Management System

## A lightweight web application built to manage product data using the core CRUDS principles (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Search).

This project demonstrates essential front-end data manipulation techniques and local storage implementation.

##  Features

* *Create:* Seamlessly add new product records.
* *Read:* Display and retrieve all stored product data in a dynamic table.
* *Update:* Modify existing product details within the table view.
* *Delete:* Remove single product records or wipe all data with a mass delete option.
* *Search:* Instant filtering of products by *Name* or *Category*.
* *Local Persistence:* Data is stored using the browser's *Local Storage*, ensuring persistence across sessions.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

The application is built using standard, vanilla web technologies:

* *HTML5:* For structural markup.
* *CSS3:* For styling (style/style.css).
* *JavaScript (Vanilla JS):* Handles all core application logic, DOM manipulation, and CRUDS functionalities (main.js).
